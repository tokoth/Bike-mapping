Huge credits to [Citi Bike System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) NewYork City, for publishing there bike rides data, this is used as my datasource for the project.

Depending on the season, the trip data files contain one record for each ride, with roughly two million records every month. It's a standard bike share system with fixed stations where a user takes up a bike from one dock and returns it to another using a key fob or a code. For each ride, the station and time the ride began and ended are recorded.


For this data visualization project a few assumptions were made so as to map only a sample of the data.

    1. Only data from the month of December was used for our mapped years i.e. year 2018, 2019 & 2020
    
    2. The data was cleaned and grouped by Station name and Station id.
    
    3. The resulting cleaned data indicated all the bike station where atleast one bike trip originated from the station.
